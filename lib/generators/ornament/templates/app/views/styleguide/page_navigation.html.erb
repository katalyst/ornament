  <p>By default, Ornament doesn't come with any out-of-the-box sidebar navigation styling.</p>
  <p>This page instead will act as a cookbook of receipes for building second-level page navigation.</p>

  <h2 class="heading-two">Managing tree levels</h2>

  <p>Simple-navigation makes it really easy to have one single tree, which is what Koi has by default, and allow rendering different parts of that tree.</p>
  <p>For example, your header might be using <code>level: 1..3</code> to render three levels of navigation, but on your internal page you want only <code>level: 2..3</code>.</p>
  <p>Understand that navigation will only render if the <strong>current page path</strong> is in the navigation tree.</p>

  <h2 class="heading-two">Conditionally showing sidebar if needed</h2>

  <p>Sometimes you have a general page show view, eg. <code>/app/views/pages/show</code>.</p>
  <p>Sometimes you need this view to show a sidebar when there are links available, and sometimes you need it to not show anything if the page is standalone.</p>
  <p>The easiest way I've found to do this is to use a temporary yield.</p>

  <div data-styleguide-code-sample>
    <pre class="sg-pre prettyprint">&lt;%# This is our temporary navigation yield %>
&lt;% content_for :page_navigation do %>
  &lt;%= koi_render_navigation "page_navigation", "header_navgiation" %>
&lt;% end %>

&lt;%# This navigation yield will only render if navigation was present %>
&lt;% if content_for? :page_navigation %>
  &lt;% content_for :sidebar %>
    &lt;div class="page--navigation">
      &lt;%= yield :navigation %>
    &lt;/div>
  &lt;% end %>
&lt;% end %></pre>
  </div>
