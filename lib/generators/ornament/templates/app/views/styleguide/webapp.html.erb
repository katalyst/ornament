<div class="content-spacing">

  <p>By default, all <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/" target="_blank">Add to Home Screen</a> functionality is disabled.</p>
  <p>There are two steps you need to take in order to create a custom UI for add to homescreen.</p>
  <p>First, open up <code>register-service-worker.js</code> and enable the flag <code>showA2HSUI</code>.
  <p>Now in your application any element you add the attribute <code>data-a2hs</code> to, will appear when the add to homescreen requirements have been met. Any element that has <code>data-a2hs-button</code> will act as the trigger button. This allows you to have accompanying content along with the action. If all you need is a button simply add both attributes to the element.</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint sg-pre">&lt;button class="a2hs-button" data-a2hs>
  &lt;button data-a2hs-button>Add to homescreen&lt;/button>
&lt;/button></pre>
