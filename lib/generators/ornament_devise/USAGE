Description:
    Generate the Ornament devise views by passing in the pluralised model name as the argument.

Example:
    rails generate ornament_devise customers

    This generates the pre-ornament-ised devise views in to the /app/views/customers folder.

    If no argument is passed in, it will default to users.
