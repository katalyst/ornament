## Working with the Dummy App

The dummy app's "app/assets" configuration includes this path:

    ../../lib/generators/ornament/templates/app/assets

The dummy app's "app/views" configuration includes this path:

    ../../lib/generators/ornament/templates/app/views

The dummy app's "vendor/assets" configuration includes this path:

    ../../lib/generators/ornament/templates/vendor/assets

This means you can modify the files in the generator template and see the
changes in the test app without re-running the generator.

However, you'll need to re-run the generator if you make changes to this file:

    lib/generators/ornament/templates/app/assets/ornament/_defaults.css.scss

When you run the generator, use this command to ensure you only regenerate the
settings files:

    rails g ornament --development -f
